                      I've been reading through Luxemburg's <em>Organizational Questions of the Russian Social Democracy</em> and Bernstein's <em>Evolutionary Socialism</em>
                      to try to articulate some thoughts on how Revisionism may have played out in Russia during its revolutionary period,
                      and whether it would've been successful at advancing socialism in Russia over the long-term.
                      As I'm fairly new to exploring Marxist philosophy, please bear with me if I misinterpret or otherwise make any mistakes.
                      These are early and loosely organized thoughts that will be part of a series in which I try to summarize and offer my take on the
                      many different leftist factions and movements vying for power before, during, and after Russia's revolutions.

                  <h3>Part One</h3>
                  <p class="blog-post-meta">September 4, 2024 by <a href="#">Vivian</a></p>
                  <hr>
                  <p class="">
                      My very tentative thoughts are that reformism and non-vanguard approaches would've probably enabled a more stable foundation for Russian leftism long-term, in the sense that:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <ul class="">
                          <li>1) A worker base that has experienced first-hand the benefits of incremental leftist policies would be primed to fight for more radical socialist movements. Basically, that smaller scale, pragmatic "sewer socialism" would energize grassroots support for revolution rather than pacifying it.</li>
                          <li>2) A decentralized movement composed of many local labor organizations and party cells is more flexible and adaptable, able to learn what policies and tactics work best in their area and among their populace; a central authority directed by a group of vanguards who try to channel instructions down through layers of hierarchy to these local organizations would be inflexible and unable to respond adequately to the needs of local movements. This would've been especially important in Russia given the sheer geographic size and population of the country.</li>
                          <li>3) A central authority is easily hijacked by charismatic, power-seeking people who know how to speak the "language" of a socialist movement, but who instead have the goal of enriching themselves and their clique. And a central authority rushing forward with the urgency of revolution would have less time to root out and safeguard itself against such opportunists. Lenin argues that opportunism arises from intellectuals taking advantage of disorganized and decentralized groups; Luxemburg argues the exact opposite in her work, and I'm inclined to believe her given the long-term outcome of the October Revolution.</li>
                          <li>4) I find Bernstein's critiques of Orthodox Marxism in <em>Evolutionary Socialism</em> were pretty insightful. He makes a few prescient points: a) small/medium scale businesses in some industries have unique advantages that outweigh benefits of economies of scale, b) scientific and technological advancement is continuously creating new markets and economic sectors where smaller capital owners spring up before larger owners take notice, and c) the power structures created by liberalism can readily be co-opted and leveraged for socialist goals in a way that feudal and autocratic power structures could not. Revolution was necessary and crucial for toppling tsarist autocracy, but the Russian Republic that rose in its place could be transformed into a socialist one without further revolution.</li>
                      </ul>
                  </p>
                  <hr>
                  <p>With further reading I'm also seeing that Luxemburg and Bernstein were at odds in many respects, with Luxemburg seeing Bernstein as excessively revisionist himself, but I'm still parsing their differences. </p>

                  <h3>Part Two</h3>
                  <p class="blog-post-meta">September 4, 2024 by <a href="#">Vivian</a></p>
                  <hr>
                  <p class="">
                      So why did the Bolsheviks specifically did so well given the apparent advantages of Revisionism? From my perspective, it is because tsarist autocracy kept a tight grip on Russia until the very last minute.
                      The exceptionally reactionary, stubborn, and outright incompetent rule of Nicholas I and II
                      (especially the latter's complete refusal to cede any power to the Duma) prevented any of the institutions of liberalism from taking root at all.
                      By the time the tsar finally abdicated in the February Revolution, the Russian State had already effectively collapsed under the strain of war. The Provisional Government
                      inherited a smoldering ruin of a country, with a populace facing profound starvation, sickness, and general human suffering; Kerensky made it even worse by launching a disaster of an offensive
                      when his first priority should've been to make peace as soon as possible and to deliver emergency aid to the populace by any means necessary. Under such dire conditions, 
                      a fast, radical, centralized, charismatic, and decisive vanguard will thrive. Hence, Bolshevik victory and control of Russian leftism post 1917.
                  </p>
                  <p>In a scenario where things go even slightly better for Russia (Alexander II isn't assassinated and his successors allow liberal reforms, Nicholas II actually cedes significant power to the Duma and 1905 Constitution, Kerensky pulls the Russian Republic out of the war early and treats the suffering of his people with the urgency it deserved, etc.)...
                  I think that's where the revisionists would have the most success.</p>

                  <h3>Introduction</h3>
                  <p class="blog-post-meta">September 1, 2024 by <a href="#">Vivian</a></p>

                  <p class="">
                      In this book, anthropologist David W. Anthony discusses the origin of Indo-European peoples from the Pontic-Caspian steppe and their language and culture.
                      He describes how they migrated into Europe and interacted with the prior population there and explains the archeological and linguistic evidence that grants us valuable insight into how
                      these ancient peoples lived, as well as the limitations of our knowledge and any unanswered questions. In particular, Anthony focuses on how Indo-Europeans domesticated the horse, invented the
                      wheel, and developed advanced bronze metallurgy, and how these technologies enabled sweeping social and political changes in IE society.

                  <hr>
                  <p>I'll be writing a series of posts that summarizes what I've read as I progress through the book, offering notes and commentary.</p>

                  <p class="blog-post-meta">September 1, 2024 by <a href="#">Vivian</a></p>
                  <hr>
                  <p class="">
                      I'm about a quarter of the way through and still taking in/processing the information covered in the book, but so far I've really enjoyed the use of comparative linguistics to a) narrow down the "original homeland" of Proto-Indo-European speakers based on reconstructed environmental words, and b) make predictions about their culture based on vocabulary and comparing it to archaeological evidence.
                  </p>

                  <p>There is also some interesting discussion on the nature of cultural, ecological, and linguistic divides and how they don't always correlate (several peoples can share cultural traits but have very different languages, while the reverse - divergent ancient cultures sharing a language - is much rarer). Interestingly, the most conclusive information about ancient peoples' cultures and languages often comes from ecological borders - in areas of transition between different biomes, peoples on either side of the boundary will develop especially strong differences between each other, and this manifests in markedly different artifacts (pottery, house styles, etc.) right on either side of the border.</p>

                  <p>I'm currently reading through a chapter that describes how early Anatolian farmers migrating to Greece/the Balkans and up into the Pontic steppe interacted with existing forager peoples and how this contact manifests in local archaeology.</p>

                      About 1/3rd done, and I'm currently reading about horse domestication. There are several clues archeologists have used (such as gender/age/size distribution of slaughtered horses, used to distinguish wild herd hunting from pasture-raised horses), but the keystone has been bit wear on horse teeth.
                  </p>

                  <p>Bitting leaves beveled wear on specific teeth from the horse chewing on the bit - metal bits wear more, but even older bits made with softer material will erode enamel. Researchers compared horse teeth from different dig sites to modern horses that had been bitted for varying amounts of time, and, were able to pinpoint where and when different steppe societies domesticated horses based on the observed enamel erosion + carbon dating of the samples.</p>

                  <h3>Part Three</h3>
                  <p class="blog-post-meta">September 1, 2024 by <a href="#">Vivian</a></p>
                  <hr>
                  <p class="">
                      Halfway through the book! It's a meaty read at 568 pages, but getting through it. I'll probably pick something lighter for my next read.
                  </p>

                  <p>We're now discussing how "Old Europe" (the pre Indo-European cultures present before ~3400 BCE) gave way to Indo-Europeans. The author talks about how the combo of horse domestication and the invention (or possibly import from Mesopotamia via the Caucasus) of wagons around 3400 BCE enabled pastoral people of the Yamnaya Horizon to grow the number and territory of their herds. </p>
                  <p>This territorial expansion led to greater conflicts between neighbors about grazing land and greater stratification of wealth as some people accumulated much larger animal/land amounts. We see this change reflected in a greater disparity of wealth buried with people in cemeteries - a reliable hallmark of status was metal tools, jewelry, and artifacts (bronze, gold, silver, etc.) in graves. The author also hypothesizes that these new territorial conflicts spurred development of the Proto-Indo-European language, as a sort of common "trade/negotiation" language among Yamnaya peoples.</p>
                  <p>Movement of Yamnaya peoples from the Pontic Steppe westward into Europe may have been spurred in part by climactic cooling and drying, leading pastoralists to seek warmer and wetter territories in the west, and so we see Yamnaya-type sites mixing in and eventually replacing Tripolye sites (a classic Old Europe culture centered around the Danube) after 3000 BCE.</p>
                  <p>Even within the Yamnaya we see differences West to East. Western Yamnaya near the Dnieper River were more agrarian and sedentary, cultivating small cereal crop plots around relatively large settlements along with the usual cattle ranching. Lots of cattle - this is about the time when lactase persistence evolved in Scandinavia and rapidly spread south, enabling many more people to consume dairy regularly. Eastern Yamnaya in the Don-Volga Basin had more horses and sheep, and seemed to do more fishing and hunting.</p>
                  <p>Western Yamnaya also appeared to be more matriarchal than Easterners based on archeological findings. Evidently, the more patriarchal Eastern Yamnaya won out in linguistic influence, as PIE has lots of specific words for patrilineal relationships, but not as many for matrilineal ones.</p>
                  <p>There's also a brief digression about the Afanasievo culture - a group of Yamnaya migrants who journeyed all the way east across the Kazakh steppe to end up near the Altai Mountains. This is the opposite of pretty much all other Indo-Europeans, and no one really knows why they traveled that way. This group was the ancestors of the Tocharians, an Indo-European culture that lived in the Tarim Basin around 400-1200 CE, a Western outlier in a region otherwise dominated by Turkic, Mongolic, and Sinitic peoples. </p>
                  <p>Fun fact: many Chinese languages may have borrowed their word for "honey" from a Tocharian language (Tocharian B's mit, which came from PIE médʰu) . Mandarin mi is likely cognate with English mead, French miel, and Russian мёд (mjod).</p>

                  <p>In which Vivi explains the purpose of this blog.</p>
                  <hr>

                  <p>I read a lot. I am not particularly good at <em>retaining</em> what I read. This blog is a way for me take notes on my readings, share them with the world, and make recommendations for neat books that I think other folks might enjoy. </p>
                  <h2>Posts I make</h2>
                  <p>What will I post about? Read on below.</p>
                  <h3>Book notes</h3>
                  <p>As mentioned above, I want to share what I read with other people.</p>
                  <!--<pre><code>Example code block</code></pre> -->
                  <p>I tend to read a lot of non-fiction. Most of it concerns history, but I'll dip into other topics as well.</p>
                  <h3>Music production</h3>
                  <p>I make electronic music. Mainly atmospheric D&B, jungle, and other breakbeat music. I'll post about what I'm making, share production tips and tutorials, and snippets of work in progress.</p>

        </ul>-->
                  <h3>Blender art</h3>
                  <p>I also make digital art in Blender. Usually for music cover art. </p>
                  <h3>About the blog's title</h3>
                  <p>Lastly...what exactly is a Неохотная Энаричка (Njeohotnaya Enarichka)?</p>
                  <blockquote>
                      <p>
                          The Anarya belonged to the most powerful Scythian aristocracy.
                          They were born male, but wore women's clothing,[6] performed women's jobs, spoke like women,[9] and were believed by the Scythians to be inherently different from other males
                          and that their androgyny was of divine origin; according to indigenous Scythian shamanic traditions, the Anarya were considered "transformed" shamans who changed their sex,
                          which characterised them as being the most powerful shamans, due to which they inspired fear and were thus accordingly given special respect in Scythian society,
                          and the Scythians ascribed their androgyny to a "female disease" causing sexual impotency.
                      </p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                      To be неохотная is to be reluctant. Although the Scythians are not related to the later Slavs who inhabited the Pontic Steppe, Slavs did not really have a "third gender" tradition
                      (or really any cultural accomodation of transness), and so I look back to the nearest culture that did. I take a sort of reluctant pride in being a trans woman from a notoriously
                      conservative culture.
